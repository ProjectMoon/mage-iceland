# Life

Spells for the Life arcanum.

## Channel Vitae (Life •••)

The mage is able to channel Vitae between herself and vampires, strix, ghouls, other living targets, or inanimate receptacles.

 * **Practice:** Weaving
 * **Primary Factor:** Potency
 * **Withstand:** Stamina (or Resistance)
 * **Suggested Rote Skills:** Intimidation, Occult, Survival

The spell allows the mage to move a quantity of Vitae up to the spell's Potency between one or more vessels she can touch, including herself, vampires, ghouls, strix, other living targets, or physical containers. Transferring the vitae into a subject forces the effects of Vitae consumption upon the it: vampires gain more Vitae, targets may become addicted, and so forth. If the Vitae is transferred into a container, it maintains its nature as Vitae for the Duration of the spell before reverting to normal substance.

The mage may channel a number of points of Vitae per turn equal to her Gnosis-derived Mana per turn limit.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may channel as much Vitae as she wants in one turn, ignoring her Gnosis-derived Mana per turn limit.

**+1 Reach and +1 Mana:** When the vitae is transferred into a subject, the effects of the Vitae are suppressed for the Duration of the spell. This effect suppresses the effects of Vitae for one subject, and can be applied multiple times.

## Vampirism (Life ••••)

The mage patterns the blood of a living subject into vampiric Vitae and draws it from the victim.

 * **Practice:** Patterning
 * **Primary Factor:** Potency
 * **Withstand:** Stamina (or Resistance)
 * **Suggested Rote Skills:** Brawl, Intimidation, Persuasion
 * **Cost:** 1 Mana

The mage patterns the blood of a living subject into vampiric Vitae and draws it from the victim. The Vitae drawn is usually in the form of blood oozing from wounds, but can be a more exotic substance, depending on the method the mage uses to "feed" on the subject. This spell generates one Vitae per Potency and deals 1 Lethal damage per Potency to the subject. The Vitae created is treated as if it came from the subject.

The Vitae remains supernatural until the Duration of the spell expires, at which point it turns back into regular substance, unless it has been consumed. The use of this spell is an affront to the vampiric Curse, and damns the mage: the mage takes 1 resistant Lethal damage per Potency of the spell.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may apply one suitable Condition or Tilt to the subject representative of the vampiric feeding.

**Add Death, Mind, or Spirit ••••:** The Mage may draw from ghosts (Death), goetia (mind), or spirits (Spirit).

**Add Prime ••••:** The Mage can convert the Vitae into tass in a form of her choosing. The tass functions both as Vitae and Mana, and if ingestible, can be consumed by Vampires (though they only benefit from it as Vitae). The tass created has the resonance keyword of "vampirism."

## Create Vitae (Life •••••)

This spell creates Vitae from nothing.

 * **Practice:** Making
 * **Primary Factor:** Potency
 * **Suggested Rote Skills:** Empathy, Medicine, Occult
 * **Withstand:** Blood Potency, Stamina, or Resistance (depending on target)
 * **Cost:** 1 Mana

The spell creates an amount of pure, inert Vitae equal to Potency in the subject, which may be a vampire, strix, living target, or container. If created outside of an animate subject, the mage chooses the form the Vitae takes (and must have a way to contain the resulting Vitae), and the spell is Withstood by the mage's own Stamina.

Vitae created by this spell is not addictive, and it does not form blood bonds. Furthermore, the vitae created by this spell can sustain a vampire of any Blood Potency. The Vitae created by this spell becomes normal substance after the Duration expires, unless it has been consumed. As always, the vampiric curse takes its debt: the mage suffers 1 resistant Lethal damage per point of Potency of the spell.

**+1 Reach:** The mage may explicitly specify the properties of the created Vitae, such as quality, addictiveness, and whether or not the Vitae can form blood bonds. Any effects dependent on another subject (such as blood bonds) require that subject to be included as a target in the spell.

**+1 Reach:** The created Vitae violates its own nature. If the mage explicitly specified properties of the Vitae, they may be paradoxical, such as animal-quality Vitae of human origin, or allowing a living target to become the regnant in a blood bond.

**Add Prime •••••:** The Mage can create the Vitae as tass in a form of her choosing. The tass functions both as Vitae and Mana, and if ingestible, can be consumed by Vampires (though they only benefit from it as Vitae). The tass created has the resonance keyword of "vampirism."
