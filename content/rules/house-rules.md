Homebrew rules for the game.

## Artifacts

The rules on artifacts in the book are a little unclear, so here are some clarifications and additions to make operating and creation of rules for artifacts smoother:

 * All effects of an artifact must directly map to a spell effect unless it's a Utility Attainment. Artifact effects can include reaches, but if more than the free reach is required, a higher Arcanum dot must be used (for more free Reach), or the artifact risks Paradox when activated.
 * The spell effect of an artifact is limited specifically on duration, potency, reach, etc unless the effect says otherwise or the effect directly replicates a spell. While the mage can use their or the artifact's gnosis + arcanum in any combination, they cannot add Reach or alter the effect's spell factors unless specifically allowed.
 * Artifacts have activation conditions. This may can be a keyword, performing certain actions, being in certain locations, or really anything.
 * Many artifacts have unique triggered abilities that the mage can activate through some means. But artifacts that have persistent effects are also possible (e.g. a ring of invisibility). For example, an artifact ring with a persistent bonus given to its wearer would have an Indefinite duration spell effect triggered by wearing of the ring (and then 1 Mana is spent from the artifact or wearer to "cast" the spell).

## Paradox

Paradox in Iceland is both more common and more dangerous, operating with these rule differences:
 - If there is a risk of Paradox, the base Paradox dice pool is increased by 1.
 - Contained Paradox deal 2 resistant bashing damage per success instead of 1.
 - When determining Paradox Reach for Anomalies, the Storyteller can spend 1 extra Reach, plus 1 more for every 3 dots of the mage's Gnosis.
 - When determining successes for a Paradox Condition, increase the successes by 1, plus 1 more for every 3 dots of the mage's Gnosis.

The extra Paradox Reach or successes only apply to the Anomalies and Conditions, not other effects. For example, the mage's spellcasting pool would not be penalized by extra Paradox successes.

## Antinomian Sorcery

While Paradox is more deadly, antinomian sorcery is easier in Iceland, and carries more powerful benefits.
 - Certain places give 9- or 8-again on Gnosis rolls to control Paradox. A few legendary places might even give the rote quality.
 - Befouling improvised spells has only a -1 penalty, instead of -3.
 - Certain magical secrets (Merits) greatly ease the ability to control Paradox.
 - When casting a befouled spell, The Storyteller only gains access to extra Paradox Reach or Succeses (as above) if the Mage completely fails to control the Paradox.
 - The character gains access to extra Paradox Reach (as above) if they successfully control all Paradox of a befouled spell, or get an exceptional success on the Gnosis roll.
