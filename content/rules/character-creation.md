These are the rules and guidelines for character creation in the game.

## Character Concept

These guidelines apply to your new character concept.

 * The character is a newly Awakened mage, and has had little to no contact with mage society in Iceland or abroad.
 * The character should have a reason to stay in Iceland indefinitely.
 * The character will be a member of a cabal, whose members are all in a similar situation.
 * While a character might be an enthusiast about things that "go bump in the night," they otherwise likely led a fairly mundane life before their Awakening (i.e. no gallavanting about with werewolves, vampires, etc).

## Character Creation Rules

These rules apply to character creation.

 * Characters should be created using the **Newly Awakened Mage template**, not the standard template in the core book. The Newly Awakened template is in Signs of Sorcery, page 133.
 * Metamorphic Awakenings (Signs of Sorcery p. 137) are allowed, but talk to me first. The entire group must also agree to the inclusion of a Metamorphic Awakening, since they can cause power imbalance.

## Allowable Source Materials

The contents from these books are in use and allowed in the game. These are available in the usual place.

 * Mage the Awakening 2E Core Book
 * Signs of Sorcery
 * Night Horrors: Nameless and Accursed
