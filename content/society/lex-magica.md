The Lex Magica is the magical law of the land, how mages govern themselves and their activities. There are four categories of laws in the Lex Magica: Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. Each category overrules the ones below it. This page summarizes some of the laws in Iceland's version of the Lex Magica.

## The Icelandic Lex Magica

Iceland's isolation from the rest of the world has made its laws diverge somewhat from that of the larger mage community in the northern hemisphere. In the Commonwealth, the goðar would create Silver Laws in their domain, and Bronze Laws from their rulings in disputes. Every year, when Sleepers gathered in Þingvellir, the mages of Iceland would also gather, and harmonize the Silver Laws of the island.

Today, the process is much the same, except the goðar do not travel into the wilderness to discuss their rulings. More for ceremony than anything else, the rituals and processes otherwise remain relatively unchanged. The goðorð are quicker to respond to Silver Law creation in other parts of the country, though.

## The Laws

### Gold Laws

Gold Laws are believed to come from the Time Before, found on artifacts or in ancient ruins, and agreed upon by multiple Consilia. Although Iceland was isolated from the greater mage community, it was not completely disconnected. Historical sources record presence of Icelandic mages in European Convocations. From there, and from the first mages who arrived in Iceland, the Gold Laws came.

### Silver Laws

The Silver Laws in Iceland are created in the individual goðorð, and officially harmonized once per year with the assistance of the Lawspeaker. During the proceedings of the law, the Lawspeaker recites the Gold Laws and Silver Laws of each goðorð, and the goði would give their assent to the law or not. Today, the Silver Law is relatively standard around the island, as the goðar react to changes and decisions in other localities much more quickly with the help of phones, the Internet, and the postal service.

The Silver Laws are most divergent around their treatment of antinomian sorcery. In the traditionalist holdouts of the Westfjords and the North, practice of Abyssal magic is openly allowed so long as the strict rules of the ancient Icelandic magical tradition are followed. In other areas, its use is restricted. It is almost outright banned in the capital region, technically only allowable under very limited circumstances.

### Bronze Laws

The Bronze Law of a goðorð consists of various rulings handed down by the goði and their associates. These set precedent for future mages to look to for guidance. An important part of the yearly ceremony is to take important Bronze Law and attempt to harmonize it into Silver Law, nation-wde. The majority of Bronze Laws are region-specific, though.

### Iron Laws

The Iron Laws consist of "all rules, oaths, and treaties ratified by a small group of mages within the Consilium’s jurisdiction — such as cabal charters, a mutual protection agreement between two cabals, or a sworn oath by one mage to perform some service for another" (MtAw 2E Core p. 69).
