The Pentacle has no useful presence in Iceland. Two Nameless Orders dominate mage politics on the island: Rúnafélagið and R6. The Seers of the Throne only have a token presence, and the other more mysterious Orders are not recorded to have any influence in Iceland at all.

## Rúnafélagið

Runes.

## R6

There are 6 Rs.

## Apostates

Ooo, scary. Also technically not an Order.

## Seers of the Throne

Surely they're not all the way up here...
